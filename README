KrzYmod highly extends Zopfli/ZopfliPNG functionality.
Without passing its special commands the program should run as usual.

Firstly it may be hard to understand what these commands are used for
and if they are actually useful for You.

In this document Zopfli switches will be used as an examples.
ZopfliPNG ones are the same but in case of additional parameters
next to the switch = sign is required.

1. --mb#

   This command tells zopfli to how many blocks at maximum split
   stream to. It's limited to 15 in the original Zopfli version
   and considered by program authors to be the best choice.
   However, it was found out that increasing number of blocks that
   stream gets split to produces smaller files.
   In case of too many blocks, stream may be slower to decompress.
   Setting it to 0 will use as many blocks as Zopfli auto block splitting
   model finds optimal.

2. --mls#

   This command alters the GetLengthScore function. Changing this parameter
   will alter certain Zopfli compression decissions and block splitting model
   which can improve or hurt compression. The default is 1024 and there is
   no logic whatsoever in changing this option other than try&error.
   However during my tests on 16KB BMP file chaging this parameter reduced
   compressed file further by 5 bytes (NOT bits).

3. --bsr#

   Block splitting recursion. Changing this options will alter block splitting
   model. The default is 9 and this is another try&error option. Setting this
   value too high will cause Zopfli to spend more time splitting stream to
   blocks, as well as, may cause Zopfli to use fewer blocks without properly
   checking if the decissions are optimal enough.

4. --mui#

   Maximum unsuccessful iterations after last best. This switch is used to
   limit Zopfli work if it can't find another bit reductions after trying
   # iterations. In order for this option to be the most useful --i# parameter
   should be set very high, for example: --i999999 --mui999 will cause Zopfli
   to give up after 999 iterations that proved to be of no use for compressed
   block size bit reduction.
   This parameter is set to 1 when CTRL+C is pressed. Zopfli will still try
   to gain some savings on each block but only if the reduction comes with
   every iteration done, if there is at least one result that is not
   the best, Zopfli will end working on that block.

5. --lazy

   Use lazy matching in LZ77 Greedy. This option has an impact on block
   splitting model and iteration progression. In original version it
   can only be changed before compiling the software and it's considered
   to be another try&error switch.

6. --ohh

   Optimize Huffman Header by Frédéric Kayser. This options changes how
   Huffman trees are encoded in dynamic blocks.
   It records 8 as 4+4 not as 6+single+single and 7 as 4+3 not as 6+single
   as in default Zopfli Huffman tree encoding.
   Enabling this mode will usually improve compression by a few bits per blocks,
   rarery the result will be worse. Sometimes also impacts block splitting model.

7. --gzipname

   This will tell Zopfli to include filename inside GZip archive, so then changing
   gz filename will not cause archived file to be renamed. Note that it will produce
   file bigger by (compressed file name length + 1) bytes.

8. --zip

   Tells Zopfli to use ZIP container instead of the default GZip. This can be useful
   on Microsoft based operating systems that support ZIP better. Note that the
   resulting file will be bigger than GZip.

9. --dir

   Tells Zopfli to read directory as input instead of file. Scan it recursively and
   compress all files found. This option works only in conjuction with --zip switch,
   as only Zip from containers supported by Zopfli can hold multiple files.
   The uniqueness of this option is that ZIP file is updated on every successfully
   compressed file. The downside to this is that file IS NOT LOCKED and deleting or
   modyfing it before closing Zopfli may cause unexpected behaviour from corrupted
   ZIP file to Zopfli Crash.
   Note that there are limitations in this mode:
    - empty directories are not added,
    - empty files are not added,
    - directory structure is maintained by files being inside, there are no real
      records of directories preset in ZIP archive (this reduces ZIP size a bit
      but deleting all files inside a directory may cause directory in ZIP file
      to disappear),
    - character encoding may be incorrect if using special letters.
   Usually the workaround for above is to use some 1 bytes file in directories that
   are supposed to be empty like empty.dir and to use english alphabets only.
   These issues may or may not be fixed in future releases (depends if there are any
   requests for them to be fixed).

10. --v#

   This option is formerly known as just -v and it extends control over Zopfli
   verbosity. The default is 2 and it can be set from 0 (quiet) to 5 (most verbose):
   * 0 - quiet mode, don't display anthing except some errors,
   * 1 - program title, percentage progress and file added when --zip & --dir are used,
   * 2 - display block progression, bytes left to compress next to percentage progress,
         as well as, summary after every file being successfully compressed,
   * 3 - display fixed/dynamic block comparison + per block summary,
   * 4 - additionally display block split points, best iterations using separate lines
         and treesize (same functionality as -v in original release),
   * 5 - additionally display block splitting decissions and current iteration being
         processed using same line until bit reduction occurs.

11. --n#

   Use dumb block splitting by telling zopfli to how many blocks split stream to.

12. --b#

   Same as above but instead use size in bytes as delimeter. This and above option
   are most likely useless unless it's required for stream to use certain amount
   of blocks or certain uncompressed block size.

13. --cbs#

   Manually pass block start positions with optional block type. The list must be
   passed in hexadecimal format, separated by commas while optionally adding
   = sign and block type of 0-2 after each start position. This can be used to tell
   Zopfli which parts of data should be stored in uncompressed block types (0) or
   forced as fixed (1), as currently Zopfli is unable to tell which data should
   not be compressed and left in uncompressed blocks. It should be noted that
   first typed block split is REALLY omitted so can be anything or even empty,
   however, a comma should be passed then. Example: ,513=0,5555,fe89=0,14532 .

14. --cbsfile#

   Same as above but instead of typing manually block start positions a file
   can be prepared holding that data. The contents MUST be the same as it would
   be passed with command line parameter, this means no new lines or any other
   characters than [0-f],[,],[=] should be used. Otherwise undefined behaviour
   may occur.

15. --cbd#

   Save block start positons to a file and exit without compressing any data.
   This is useful in case of testing various options while preserving block
   boundaries by feeding --cbsfile with that file data. This option works
   in auto splitting mode, manual splitting mode and manual+auto splitting mode.

16. --aas

   Enables additional auto splitting mode when custom block start positions are passed
   so Zopfli can still decide between the boundaries if the data should be split
   further while preserving start positions that were passed by other command
   line switches. Each data between manually passed block start positions is
   analysed separately as if it were separate stream inputs (files).

17. --rw# and --rz#

   Initial random W and Z for iterations. These parameters are 1 for W and 2 for Z
   by default and they are locked in original Zopfli. They are used to init
   Multiply-With-Carry random generator before iterations per given block start.
   The random values are 32 bit unsigned integers that are generated when
   zopfli iteration is above 5 and the produced size is the same as the one before it.
   So changing these values will change random numbers being generated and make
   Zopfli find best result on lower or higher iteration than on default values.
   They are useful when re-running Zopfli multiple times with limited number of
   iterations while incrementing/randomizing --rw and/or --rz. The results
   per block can be compared or maybe even mixed together to produce yet
   smaller result with certain tools. Note that during my tests I got further
   1 bit reduction when changing these parameters on --mui999 when previously
   the file was created doing as many as 99,999 unsucessful iteration.


Additionally to mentioned above options KrzYmod Zopfli version also fix few issues found
in original release, for example incorrect Deflate stream size being raported.
Also supports Unix (gzip) and MS-DOS (zip) timestamps inside archives.
